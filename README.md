# Yammy-Kitchen

It's a 2-week student group project. The purpose of this project was to choose a website, which does not have much responsiveness, and update it. We chose the Yammy kitchen website, and we made a new responsive design. This project focused only on design and layout, therefore only HTML and CSS/Bootstrap were used.
